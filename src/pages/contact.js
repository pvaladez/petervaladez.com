          Whether you are a fellow developer looking to chat, have feedback
          for this site, or have a project in mind I would love to hear from
          you! The web developer community has taught me a lot over the years,
          and I love that I have been able to find people who are more talented
          than me and willing to share their ideas. In appreciation of that, I
          would love to give back in any way I can.
        </p>
